What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. block scope.
Variable scope is a relm of script that is visble. Throughout the range of JavaScript code there are two different kinds 
of scope. One you have global, which are usually the variables with const and capable of reusing them again. While block i
s used through out the function. Once, it is called through the function and is closed it goes back to the value outside of the function. As if it didn't 
exist before. 

Why are global variables avoided?
The reason global variables are avoided because it can make your script full of debug as well as confusing. 
Most of the times we try not to use global variables because cause they can cause debugs throughout your script. For 
example, If you were to write a global variable in once file, and connect another file that already has that variable. 
It could get overridden by the new code that you wrote and leaves the others unpure. It can become a problem when working 
with teams when your using global variables. The last thing you want is a small missed communication about a variable and every one is 
using a global. One will get overridden while the other will act as if it doesn't exist or even output 'Error'.

Explain JavaScript's strict mode
If you ever see 'use strict' in a script that means the file is in strict mode. It only allows you to declare let and const
variables throughout the script. If you try to use a global it will comeback with an error. You can set them for the whole 
file or for a function. 

What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
A pure function inputs always return the same outputs and that doesn't have side effects. When you call your pure function to
return something differnt then the orginal output that means you have created a side effect and as well as a impure function which 
can or will cause bugs later through out your script.
